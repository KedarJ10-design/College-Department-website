  README: College Department Website

  ## About This Project
  This is a modern, responsive, multi-page website for a university's Computer Science department. It's designed to be clean, professional, and user-friendly, providing essential information to prospective students, current students, and faculty. The site is built as a Single Page Application (SPA).

  ## Pages Included
  - Home: A welcoming landing page with an overview of the department.
  - Faculty: A directory of faculty members.
  - Courses: A list of courses offered by the department.
  - Achievements: A showcase of recent student and faculty accomplishments.
  - Contact: Contact information and a functional contact form.

  ## Technologies Used
  - HTML5: For the core structure and content.
  - CSS3: For custom styling, animations, and responsive design (Flexbox/Grid).
  - React (v19): A JavaScript library for building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
  - React Router (v7): For handling client-side routing in the SPA.
  - TypeScript: For adding static types to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
  - No external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind) are used.

  ## How to Open Locally
  This is a React application and requires a development server to run correctly. You cannot open the `index.html` file directly in the browser.

  1. **Prerequisites:** You need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
  2. **Run the project:** In a real-world scenario, you would run `npm install` and then `npm start` in the project directory. For this specific environment, the development server is handled automatically.
